**Guess A Number Project**
-

Basic React Native application / Testing was done through Expo


Important concepts covered and implmented: Components, constants, props, and states

* **Components** are used to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, that can be referenced and used in different screens


* **Props** are used for passing data from one component to another. The data is being passed in a uni-directional flow: from parent to child.

* **States** are mutable and are set and updated by the object.
